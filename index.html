<center><h3 class="EC">Early Life </h3></center>
<p>Mon Laferte is a Chilian singer who refuses to be typecast in one genre. With a smooth and infectious voice, the singer firmly stands her ground on voicing her support for various social justice issues.
    Born as Norma Monserrat Bustamante Laferte, she was born in Vina del Mar, Chile. Growing up in a household of females, with mum, grandmother, and sister, they faced many of life’s challenges. Nine-year-old Norma was captivated by the sound of Bolero love songs. She performed at a school singing competition and became enchanted by the feeling it gave her. Later as she grew, her confidence rose too, and she traveled back and forth to the city of Valparaiso, where she regularly busked on the streets.

<center><h3 class="MC">Musical career</h3></center>
<p>In 2003, she took part in Chiles famous entertainment TV show “Rojo Fama contrafama” she didn’t win, but the show opened doors for her, and she recorded her first album, “La chica de Roja,” which gained massive success in the country. After singing covers for a while, she was keen to work on her material. In 2007, she moved alone to Mexico. With no friends or connections in the country, she went back to busking on the streets. While at home she began recording songs and uploading them to social media. In 2009 she was given devastating news when diagnosed with thyroid cancer. It automatically puts a stop to her music for a while. Two years later, she came back with her second album, “Desechable” her sound had moved to rock/pop, and Mon fronted the metal band “Mystica Girls,” whom she stayed for three years. </p>p>
